        "The CSS you've provided is designed to style a form and its elements within a component or area identified by the class `.AddNewTodo`. Here's a breakdown of what each section of your CSS does:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Styling the Form Container\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form {\n",
        "    padding: 1rem 1rem calc(1rem + 40px) 1rem;\n",
        "    width: 500px;\n",
        "    background: white;\n",
        "    border-radius: 4px;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`padding`**: Sets the padding inside the form. The padding is set to `1rem` on the top, right, and left. The bottom padding is calculated as `1rem + 40px`, providing extra space at the bottom of the form, likely to accommodate additional elements or provide a visual offset.\n",
        "- **`width`**: Sets the form’s width to `500px`, making it a fixed-width element.\n",
        "- **`background`**: The background color of the form is set to white.\n",
        "- **`border-radius`**: Rounded corners are applied with a radius of `4px`, giving the form slightly rounded edges.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Styling Text Inputs within the Form\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .text input {\n",
        "    padding: 1rem;\n",
        "    width: 100%;\n",
        "    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\n",
        "    border: none;\n",
        "    font-size: 1.2rem;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`padding`**: Each text input within a container with the class `.text` has padding of `1rem`, making the input taller and easier to interact with.\n",
        "- **`width`**: The input takes up 100% of the width of its parent container, ensuring it stretches fully within the `.text` container.\n",
        "- **`margin-bottom`**: A margin of `0.5rem` is added to the bottom of each input, spacing it away from whatever is below it.\n",
        "- **`border`**: No border is applied to these inputs, giving them a clean, flat appearance.\n",
        "- **`font-size`**: Increases the font size inside the input to `1.2rem`, making the text larger and more readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Focus State for Text Inputs\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .text input:focus {\n",
        "    outline: none;\n",
        "    border-bottom: 1px solid #0080ff;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`:focus`**: This pseudo-class applies styles when an input is focused (clicked or tabbed into).\n",
        "- **`outline`**: Removes the default focus outline that browsers apply, often used to customize the focus style more closely.\n",
        "- **`border-bottom`**: Adds a solid blue bottom border (`#0080ff`) to the input when it is focused, providing a visual cue that the element is active.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Styling Additional Container Elements\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .remind {\n",
        "    display: flex;\n",
        "    align-items: center;\n",
        "    padding: 0.5rem;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`display: flex`**: The `.remind` container uses Flexbox, making it easier to align child elements.\n",
        "- **`align-items`**: Vertically centers the children of the `.remind` container.\n",
        "- **`padding`**: Applies a padding of `0.5rem` around the content inside `.remind`, creating space around the internal elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Paragraph Styling within the Form\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form p {\n",
        "    margin-left: 10px;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`margin-left`**: Applies a left margin of `10px` to paragraphs inside the form, likely to indent them or separate them from other content to their left.\n",
        "\n",
        "This CSS provides a well-structured and visually pleasing layout and styling for a form, ensuring readability, ease of use, and a clean modern appearance."

        "The additional CSS you provided continues to style various elements within the `.AddNewTodo form` context, focusing on layout, spacing, and interactivity features for different sections. Let's break down each part:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Styling the Title Section\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .title {\n",
        "    display: flex;\n",
        "    align-items: center;\n",
        "    margin-bottom: 5px;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`display: flex`**: The `.title` class within the form is styled as a flex container, which means any child elements will be laid out as flex items in a row by default.\n",
        "- **`align-items: center`**: This ensures that the child elements of `.title` are vertically centered relative to each other, which is helpful for aligning text or icons properly when they have different sizes.\n",
        "- **`margin-bottom: 5px`**: Adds a small space below the title section, separating it from subsequent content.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Styling the \"Pick Day\" Section\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .pick-day {\n",
        "    padding: 1.5rem 1.5rem 0 1.5rem;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`padding`**: Applies padding of `1.5rem` to the top, left, and right of the `.pick-day` container. The bottom padding is `0`, which might be used to closely align it with subsequent elements without additional space at the bottom.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Styling the \"Pick Time\" Section\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .pick-time {\n",
        "    padding: 1.5rem;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`padding`**: Uniform padding of `1.5rem` is added on all sides of the `.pick-time` container, ensuring ample space around the content for touch targets or visual separation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Styling the \"Pick Project\" Section\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .pick-project {\n",
        "    padding: 0.5rem;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`padding`**: A minimal padding of `0.5rem` around the `.pick-project` section, providing basic separation from other form elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Flex Container for Projects\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .pick-project .projects {\n",
        "    display: flex;\n",
        "    flex-wrap: wrap;\n",
        "    padding: 1rem 1rem 0 1rem;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`display: flex`**: Establishes a flex container for the `.projects` class, allowing for a flexible layout of child elements.\n",
        "- **`flex-wrap: wrap`**: Allows the flex items (projects) to wrap onto multiple lines, which is useful when there are many project options that need to fit within the container.\n",
        "- **`padding`**: Padding is applied to the top, left, and right with no padding at the bottom, similar to `.pick-day`, for a tight layout flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Styling Individual Projects\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .pick-project .projects .project {\n",
        "    border: 1px solid #0080ff;\n",
        "    border-radius: 5px;\n",
        "    padding: 5px;\n",
        "    margin: 5px;\n",
        "    cursor: pointer;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`border`**: Each `.project` item has a `1px` solid border with a color `#0080ff` (blue), which visually delineates individual projects.\n",
        "- **`border-radius: 5px`**: Rounded corners enhance the visual appeal, making the project tags feel more interactive and friendly.\n",
        "- **`padding: 5px`**: Small padding inside each project element ensures the content within has some space away from the borders.\n",
        "- **`margin: 5px`**: Provides spacing between individual project items, ensuring they do not touch each other.\n",
        "- **`cursor: pointer`**: Changes the cursor to a pointer when hovering over the project elements, indicating to users that they are clickable.\n",
        "\n",
        "These styles collectively create a user-friendly and visually appealing form for adding new to-do tasks, with clear, interactive sections for selecting date, time, and project associated with the task. The use of flexbox enhances the responsiveness and adaptability of the layout, making it suitable for various screen sizes."

        "The CSS rules provided continue to define the appearance and layout of various interactive elements within a form for adding new tasks, specifically within a `.AddNewTodo` context. This part of the stylesheet focuses on specific actions like project selection, form cancellation, and confirmation. Here's a detailed breakdown of these styles:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Styling the Active Project Selection\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .pick-project .projects .active {\n",
        "    background: #0080ff;\n",
        "    color: white;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`background: #0080ff`**: Sets the background color of the active project to a vivid blue (#0080ff). This visual cue highlights the currently selected project.\n",
        "- **`color: white`**: Sets the text color to white, ensuring good contrast and readability against the blue background.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Styling the Cancel Button\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .cancel {\n",
        "    position: absolute;\n",
        "    top: 0;\n",
        "    right: 5px;\n",
        "    cursor: pointer;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`position: absolute`**: Positions the cancel button absolutely relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (likely the form, if the form has a position context such as `relative`).\n",
        "- **`top: 0; right: 5px`**: Places the button at the top right corner of its positioned container, with a 5px offset from the right edge, making it easily accessible for closing or canceling the form.\n",
        "- **`cursor: pointer`**: Changes the cursor to a pointer on hover to indicate that the element is clickable, enhancing user interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Styling the Confirm Button Container\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .confirm {\n",
        "    position: absolute;\n",
        "    bottom: 0;\n",
        "    left: 0;\n",
        "    width: 100%;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`position: absolute`**: Like the cancel button, the confirm section is positioned absolutely to anchor it at the bottom of its container.\n",
        "- **`bottom: 0; left: 0`**: Ensures the confirmation actions (e.g., a submit button) are fixed at the bottom of the form, spanning from left to right.\n",
        "- **`width: 100%`**: Stretches the container across the full width of the parent, which is likely the form itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Styling the Confirm Button\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".AddNewTodo form .confirm button {\n",
        "    width: 100%;\n",
        "    height: 40px;\n",
        "    background: #0080ff;\n",
        "    color: white;\n",
        "    font-size: 1.1rem;\n",
        "    border: none;\n",
        "    border-radius: 0 0 4px 4px;\n",
        "    cursor: pointer;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **`width: 100%`**: The button occupies the full width of its container, making it prominent and easy to interact with.\n",
        "- **`height: 40px`**: Specifies the height of the button, making it tall enough for easy clicking or tapping.\n",
        "- **`background: #0080ff; color: white`**: Uses the same blue and white color scheme as the active project selection for consistency, enhancing the visual and interactive design.\n",
        "- **`font-size: 1.1rem`**: Slightly larger font size for better readability.\n",
        "- **`border: none`**: Removes any border from the button, maintaining a clean and modern look.\n",
        "- **`border-radius: 0 0 4px 4px`**: Rounds only the bottom corners of the button, aligning with the overall form’s aesthetics.\n",
        "- **`cursor: pointer`**: Indicates that the button is clickable, a standard UI indication for buttons.\n",
        "\n",
        "These CSS rules collectively enhance the user experience by providing clear, visually distinct interaction cues and positioning important UI elements like cancel and confirm actions strategically within the form. This arrangement ensures that the form is not only functional but also user-friendly, facilitating easy navigation and actions within the form."
