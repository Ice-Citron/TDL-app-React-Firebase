        "\n",
        "```css\n",
        "clamp(min-value, preferred-value, max-value)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's break it down:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `min-value`: The smallest value the property can have.\n",
        "2. `preferred-value`: The ideal value you want to use.\n",
        "3. `max-value`: The largest value the property can have.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `clamp()` function ensures that the value stays within the specified range. It works like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "- If the preferred value is less than the minimum, it uses the minimum value.\n",
        "- If the preferred value is between the minimum and maximum, it uses the preferred value.\n",
        "- If the preferred value is greater than the maximum, it uses the maximum value.\n",
        "\n",
        "In your case, using it within `calc()` is a great approach. Here's an example of how you might use it:\n",
        "\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".Todos {\n",
        "  width: clamp(300px, 35vw, 600px);\n",
        "}\n",

        "  width: calc(clamp(300px, 35vw, 600px) - 20px);\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "- The `.Todos` element will have a width of 35% of the viewport width, but never less than 300px or more than 600px.\n",
        "- The `.EditTodo` element will have the same width as `.Todos`, minus 20 pixels, while still respecting the same minimum and maximum constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using `clamp()` within `calc()` allows you to perform additional calculations while still maintaining the min/max boundaries, which is very useful for responsive designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Is there anything else you'd like to know about `clamp()` or how it interacts with `calc()`?"

        "\n",
        "You're right to question this. Looking at the CSS for `.Todos`, it appears that this component doesn't have a specifically positioned parent element mentioned in this snippet. This has important implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Absolute Positioning: The `position: absolute` property on `.Todos` will position it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. If no ancestor has a `position` set (other than the default `static`), it will be positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is typically the viewport.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Viewport-based Positioning: The use of `bottom: 10vh;` and `left: 20vw;` means the `.Todos` component is being positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. No Explicit Parent: Without a positioned parent, the absolute positioning is essentially working at the \"global\" level of your page layout.\n",
        "\n",
        "This setup can work, but it might lead to unexpected behavior in some cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The component might overlap with other content if not carefully managed.\n",
        "- It might not respond as expected to changes in layout or screen size.\n",
        "- It could potentially cause issues with responsive design.\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve this, you could:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Add a positioned container:\n",
        "   ```css\n",
        "   .app-container {\n",
        "     position: relative;\n",
        "     width: 100%;\n",
        "     height: 100vh;\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   And wrap your `.Todos` component in this container in your HTML/JSX.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for more robust layout control.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. If the current layout works for your design, you might keep it as is, but be aware of potential limitations with absolute positioning directly to the viewport.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given this context, the positioning is working as intended based on the viewport, not relative to a parent component. If you're experiencing specific issues with the layout, it might be helpful to see how this component interacts with others on your page."

        "   Custom properties (like `--todos-width`) are scoped to the element they're defined on and its descendants. In your case, `--todos-width` is defined on `.Todos`, which means it's not automatically available to `.EditTodo` unless `.EditTodo` is a descendant of `.Todos`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Making the variable globally available:\n",
        "   If `.EditTodo` is not a child of `.Todos`, you should define the variable at a higher level, typically the `:root` pseudo-class, to make it globally available:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```css\n",
        "   :root {\n",
        "     --todos-width: clamp(300px, 35vw, 600px);\n",
        "   }\n",

        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Browser support:\n",
        "   Ensure you're using a modern browser that supports CSS Custom Properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Syntax:\n",
        "   Double-check that there are no typos in the variable name.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Debugging:\n",
        "   You can use browser developer tools to inspect if the custom property is being correctly set and inherited.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're still unable to reference the variable, it would be helpful to see more of your CSS structure and perhaps the HTML structure as well. There might be some cascading or inheritance issues that aren't apparent from this snippet alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Is `.EditTodo` a child of `.Todos` in your HTML structure? If not, using the `:root` approach should solve the issue. Let me know if you need any further clarification or if you're still experiencing problems after trying this."

        "3. `absolute`:\n",

        "5. `sticky`:\n",
        "   - A hybrid of `relative` and `fixed` positioning.\n",
