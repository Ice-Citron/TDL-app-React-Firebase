        "Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation of the return block in the `Calendar` component:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Structure Overview\n",
        "The `return` statement in the `Calendar` component contains JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React to describe what the UI should look like. The JSX in this block defines a hierarchical structure of HTML-like elements that will be rendered to the DOM.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Top-Level Container\n",
        "- `<div className='Calendar'>`: This `div` acts as the top-level container for the entire calendar component. The class `Calendar` is likely used for styling purposes, defining the layout, spacing, and other visual aspects of the calendar.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Header Section\n",
        "- `<div className=\"header\">`: Nested within the top-level `div`, this `div` serves as a container for the calendar's header, grouping together the title and button(s) for a structured layout.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Title Subsection\n",
        "- `<div className=\"title\">`: A further nested `div` that specifically contains the title elements of the calendar.\n",
        "  - `<CalendarDate size=\"18\"/>`: This is a React component (likely a styled icon from `react-bootstrap-icons`) that renders a calendar-related icon with a size property set to `18`. This visual element helps users recognize the functionality associated with the calendar.\n",
        "  - `<p>Calendar</p>`: A paragraph element that simply displays the text \"Calendar\", serving as a label or heading for the calendar component.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Button Subsection\n",
        "- `<div className=\"btns\">`: Another nested `div` within the header, specifically for containing buttons or interactive elements.\n",
        "  - `<span><CaretUp size=\"20\" /></span>`: Inside a `span`, the `CaretUp` icon (another component from `react-bootstrap-icons`) is used, with a size of `20`. This icon could be a button for navigating through the calendar (like moving to a future or past date). The use of a `span` suggests it's styled as an inline element, maintaining flow with other text or icons.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Items Section\n",
        "- `<div className=\"items\">`: This `div` is placed outside the header but still within the main `Calendar` container. It serves as a dynamic content area where individual calendar items are listed.\n",
        "  - `{ calendarItems.map(item => ...)}`: This expression uses JavaScript's `map` function to iterate over each item in the `calendarItems` array. For each item, it returns a `div` that contains the item data.\n",
        "    - `<div className=\"item\" key={item}>`: Each item from the `calendarItems` array is wrapped in its own `div` with a class of `item`. The `key` prop is crucial in lists in React for performance and re-rendering efficiency; it should be a unique identifier, so if `item` isn't unique, another unique identifier should be used.\n",
        "    - `{item}`: The content of the item is rendered within the `div`, displaying whatever data each `item` contains.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "The layout of the `Calendar` component is organized into distinct sections for clear functionality and aesthetics. The header provides interactive elements and labeling, while the items section dynamically renders content based on an array, facilitating scalability and flexibility in what the calendar displays. This structure not only organizes the content effectively but also enhances user interaction through intuitive design elements like icons and titles."

        "Here's an explanation of the different CSS properties you asked about from the CSS snippet you provided:\n",
        "\n",
        "### CSS `justify-content` Property\n",
        "The `justify-content` property in CSS is used with flexbox to align flex items along the main axis of their container. Here are the common values it can take:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`flex-start`**: Items align to the start of the flex container. For a row, this is on the left side; for a column, it's at the top.\n",
        "- **`flex-end`**: Items align to the end of the flex container. For a row, this is on the right side; for a column, it's at the bottom.\n",
        "- **`center`**: Items are centered along the line.\n",
        "- **`space-between`**: Items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line.\n",
        "- **`space-around`**: Items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them.\n",
        "- **`space-evenly`**: Items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "In your CSS, `justify-content: center;` is used, meaning that the items (such as an icon within a button) will be centered within their flex container, both on the main axis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### CSS `transition` Property\n",
        "The `transition` property is used to control the intermediate states in CSS property changes, providing a way to define the duration and timing of transitions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`property`**: Specifies the CSS property to which the transition is applied.\n",
        "- **`duration`**: Specifies the duration over which transitions take place. Expressed in seconds (`s`) or milliseconds (`ms`).\n",
        "- **`timing-function`**: Describes how the transition will proceed over its duration, allowing for easing effects (e.g., `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`).\n",
        "- **`delay`**: Defines when the transition will start.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, `transition: all 300ms ease-in-out;` applies to all changeable properties, takes 300 milliseconds to complete, and uses `ease-in-out` for a smooth start and end.\n",
        "\n",
        "### CSS `cursor` Property\n",
        "The `cursor` property in CSS changes the type of cursor displayed when the mouse hovers over an element. It helps indicate the type of interaction available:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`auto`**: Default rendering by the browser.\n",
        "- **`pointer`**: Indicates a link (typically shown as a hand pointer).\n",
        "- **`default`**: Default cursor (typically an arrow).\n",
        "- **`text`**: Indicates text that can be selected (shown as an I-beam).\n",
        "- **`move`**: Indicates something is moveable.\n",
        "- **`not-allowed`**: Indicates that the action triggered by the click is not permitted.\n",
        "\n",
        "In your CSS, `cursor: pointer;` is used, suggesting that the element is clickable, commonly used for buttons, links, and clickable items."
