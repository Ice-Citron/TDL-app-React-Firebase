        "project and key are the default function parameter (dk if this is the correct terminology for function params in JSX, function input? )\n",
        "\n",
        "but for the \"key\" is this default for all div boxes? does it means the div boxes' keys?\n",

        "The snippet you've shown is a JSX element `<Project />` being used in a React application, and it includes a few props (properties) being passed to it. Let’s clarify the terms and concepts involved:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Props**: In React, props (short for properties) are similar to function parameters. They are used to pass data and event handlers down to child components from parent components. In your example, `project`, `key`, and `edit` are all props being passed to the `<Project />` component.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`project` Prop**: This is a custom prop that is likely used to pass the entire `project` object to the `<Project />` component. The component can then use this data to render appropriate UI elements or perform other logic based on the project data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`key` Prop**: In React, `key` is a special prop that's important in lists of elements. It is used by React’s reconciliation algorithm to manage updates. The `key` should be a unique identifier that helps React keep track of which items have changed, are added, or are removed. This helps improve performance and prevent issues with item state in lists. It is not a prop that affects or controls styling or behavior directly like other props.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The `key` prop isn’t just for `<div>` elements—it should be used on any component or element within a map/list operation in React.\n",
        "   - It’s not visible to the child component (i.e., you cannot access `this.props.key` within the `<Project />` component). It’s purely for React's internal tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`edit` Prop**: This appears to be another custom prop which might be a function or a boolean flag that tells the `<Project />` component whether it is in an \"edit\" mode or some other state that changes how the component behaves or appears.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "So, in your example:\n",
        "- `project={[project]}` and `edit={edit}` are props used for passing down data and behaviors to the `<Project />` component.\n",
        "- `key={project.id}` is a special React prop used internally by React to optimize rendering performance in lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "These props help configure the `<Project />` component for specific uses, such as displaying project details or allowing project editing, depending on what is passed down from the parent component."

        "these 2 are bootstrap icons, pencil and XCircle. but what does being spans mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "In the HTML snippet you provided, the use of `<span>` tags containing Bootstrap icons (`Pencil` and `XCircle`) serves a specific purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of `<span>` Tags\n",
        "- **Container Role**: The `<span>` tag is commonly used in HTML to act as an inline container for small segments of HTML and/or JavaScript. When used in your snippet, each `<span>` is acting as a container for an individual icon.\n",
        "- **Styling and Scripting**: `<span>` is often chosen because it is inherently a non-semantic, inline element, which means it does not introduce any additional meaning to the markup (like `<div>` or `<button>` might). This makes `<span>` ideal for cases where you only need to apply styling or attach event handlers without affecting the document's outline.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How `<span>` is used here\n",
        "- **Custom Styling**: Each `<span>` is given a `className` (`edit` for the pencil icon and `delete` for the X-circle icon). These classes can be targeted with CSS to apply specific styles, such as padding, margins, cursor changes (to indicate clickability), or even layout behaviors if flex styling is applied to the parent `<div>`.\n",
        "- **Icon Presentation**: Inside each `<span>`, a React component that renders an icon (`Pencil` and `XCircle`) is included. These components likely come from a library (like `react-bootstrap-icons`), which makes scalable vector icons available as React components. The `size=\"13\"` property specifies the size of the icons, ensuring they fit appropriately within the UI.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Use\n",
        "- **Interactivity**: Given that these spans are labeled as `edit` and `delete`, they likely serve interactive roles, such as triggering edit and delete functions when clicked. This setup allows developers to easily attach event listeners to these spans for handling user interactions.\n",
        "- **Accessibility**: While `<span>` itself does not convey semantic meaning, using appropriate ARIA roles and attributes (like `role=\"button\"` and `aria-label`) can make these spans accessible, informing screen reader users that these spans are interactive elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, in your provided code, the `<span>` tags are used to contain and style icons that serve specific functions within the user interface, without adding any semantic weight to the document structure. They are ideal for when you need to apply styles or behavior to content without affecting the surrounding layout significantly."
