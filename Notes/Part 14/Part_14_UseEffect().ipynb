        "\n",
        "1. Why `useEffect` is needed:\n",
        "\n",
        "When you update state in React, it triggers a re-render of the component. If you update state directly in the component body, outside of any hooks or event handlers, it will cause an infinite loop of renders. This is because each render will update the state, which causes another render, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How `useEffect` prevents infinite render errors:\n",
        "\n",
        "`useEffect` allows you to perform side effects (like updating state) in a controlled way. It runs after the render is committed to the screen, which prevents the infinite loop. By using a dependency array, you can control when the effect runs, further preventing unnecessary re-renders.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How to use `useEffect` with Context:\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a basic example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```jsx\n",
        "import React, { useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';\n",
        "import { MyContext } from './MyContext';\n",
        "\n",
        "function MyComponent() {\n",
        "  const { contextValue, setContextValue } = useContext(MyContext);\n",
        "  const [localState, setLocalState] = useState('');\n",
        "\n",
        "  useEffect(() => {\n",
        "    // This effect runs when localState changes\n",

        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How `useEffect` works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `useEffect` function is called after every render of the component.\n",
        "- The first argument to `useEffect` is a function that contains the code to run.\n",
        "- The second argument is an array of dependencies. The effect will only run if one of these dependencies has changed since the last render.\n",
        "- If you provide an empty array `[]`, the effect will only run once, after the initial render.\n",
        "- If you don't provide a second argument, the effect will run after every render.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the example above, the effect runs whenever `localState` or `setContextValue` changes. This ensures that the context is only updated when necessary, preventing unnecessary re-renders and potential infinite loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using `useEffect`, you're essentially saying \"After the component renders, check if these values have changed, and if they have, run this code.\" This is different from running the code directly in the component body, which would happen on every render regardless of whether the values have changed.\n",
